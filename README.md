# discordbot

THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOU EXECUTE IT BECAUSE OF AUTH TOKENS AND I CANNOT GIVE MINE AWAY FOR OBVIOUS REASONS (highly recommend you to get an auth token from the official discord developer site) 


run bot.py through cmd ,
After it successfully starts you should see a message "Running"


The comman-prefix i have used here is "." , so anything followed by a "." is a command and if it detects a command (type .help for more info) it executes it
More functionalities can be added or improved upon easily
